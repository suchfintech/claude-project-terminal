Build a system to show BTC positions risk and rewards reports. Positions are Options, Futures in Deribit. 

## Claude

I'll help you create a system to analyze and report risk and rewards for BTC positions on Deribit. Let's break this down into a well-structured project that handles both Options and Futures positions.

First, let's create a basic project structure with the essential components:


### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: requirements.txt



### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: .env.example



### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: src/config.py



### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: src/models/position.py



### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: src/services/deribit_client.py



### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: src/analysis/risk_calculator.py



### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: src/reporting/position_reporter.py



### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: src/main.py


This system provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and analyzing BTC positions on Deribit. Here's what each component does:

1. **Config**: Contains all configuration parameters and API credentials
2. **Position Model**: Defines the data structure for both Options and Futures positions
3. **Deribit Client**: Handles all API interactions with Deribit
4. **Risk Calculator**: Analyzes position and portfolio risks
5. **Position Reporter**: Generates reports and visualizations

To use the system:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Deribit API credentials
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python src/main.py`

The system will:
- Fetch all open positions from Deribit
- Calculate risk metrics for each position
- Generate a portfolio summary
- Create visualizations of position distribution
- Export data to CSV for further analysis

The risk analysis includes:
- Position-level metrics (VaR, max loss, leverage risk)
- Portfolio-level metrics (total value, PnL, diversity)
- Position distribution visualization
- Historical performance tracking

Would you like me to explain any specific component in more detail or add additional features to the system?

add a README.md

## Claude

I'll create a comprehensive README.md that explains the project setup, features, and usage.


### File Operation Result (create):
✓ File created successfully: README.md
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deribit_positions.git
cd deribit_positions
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your Deribit API credentials.

## Configuration

The system can be configured through `src/config.py` and environment variables:

- `DERIBIT_API_KEY`: Your Deribit API key
- `DERIBIT_API_SECRET`: Your Deribit API secret
- `RISK_THRESHOLD`: Custom risk threshold for alerts
- `REPORT_INTERVAL`: Reporting frequency in minutes

## Usage

Run the main script to start the analysis:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Available Commands

- `--report`: Generate a one-time report
- `--monitor`: Start continuous monitoring
- `--backtest`: Run historical analysis
- `--export`: Export data to CSV

Example:
```bash
python src/main.py --report --export
```

## Risk Metrics

### Position-Level Metrics
- Value at Risk (VaR)
- Maximum potential loss
- Greeks (for options)
- Leverage ratio
- Position size relative to portfolio

### Portfolio-Level Metrics
- Portfolio VaR
- Correlation matrix
- Risk concentration
- Total exposure
- Sharpe ratio

## Report Types

1. **Summary Report**
   - Overview of all positions
   - Key risk metrics
   - Portfolio statistics

2. **Detailed Position Report**
   - Individual position analysis
   - Risk breakdown
   - Historical performance

3. **Risk Alert Report**
   - Positions exceeding risk thresholds
   - Leverage warnings
   - Correlation alerts
